#### Introduction
VitonBet is an Android betting application that will allow users to place bets on eSports events and to gamble on user created events. Casino mode also available to gamble and sending cash to other users available too.

This application is part of the Mobile Software Development assignment.

- Refer to the **Design Document** for more information.

#### Idea/Goal

- The goal for this application is to create a **fun** and **friendly** betting application that doesn’t use real currency.
- **Logging** in and **Registration** is vital for this application as we want more than one user to be able to use this application.
- Creating **events** and **placing bets** on events is a key feature in VitonBet as you can’t have a betting application without actually placing bets. Events will also be deleted when the outcome of the specific event is released.
- Users to be able to **transfer funds** to other users is another feature that replaced the cash out feature.
- Using **Firebase** instead of SQLite as it’s online, it’s already set up and it’s easier to use.
- **Age confirmation** as gambling on sports is for adults only, even though this application doesn’t use real currency, we would like to keep it as authentic as possible to real betting applications.
- If the user runs out of money, there is the feature where another user can send some funds to help that user out or the user is able to watch some **advertisements** to gain some funds.
- A **navigator** to allow users to switch to different modes within the application.

#### Testing

Pixel on Android 7.1.1

- Works perfectly on the **Pixel phone**, nothing lags or bugs out in the application.
- The application is optimised for the Pixel phone too.
- The navigator is placed correctly and works as it should work, images, text etc. are all positioned well and the application is extremely easy to use.

#### Evaluation

- Overall the application **followed the design document** that was set out by the team.
- The use of **Firebase** was also important and proved to be a major factor on how this application runs and sets up the database.
- When it comes to which to use: Firebase or SQLite we chose Firebase as we didn’t have to write schemas and we have easy GUI access online, it is also automatically back up, there are just a lot of pros with Firebase.
- Everything in the application works as it should work.
- The registration and login pages have a strong error handling in it to prevent users making mistakes.
- The **user interface** for VitonBet makes it easy for the user to navigate throughout the application and to hardly make any mistakes.
- The **casino mode** and **events** were the challenging aspect of this project as they involved a lot of probability and database work, although in the end it all works to the standard that was set.
